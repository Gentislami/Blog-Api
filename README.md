# Blog API
This is meant as show of .NET C# features for presentation purposes and teaching, it is not meant to be used or deployed on any live server.
This project implements only the back-end as a REST API. It does not and will not come with a front-end as part of this project. It can work with any front-end application that follows its API schema.
I will add features from time to time as I see fit.
